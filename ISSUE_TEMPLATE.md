### Azure DevOps Extension you are using
*There are a number of Azure DevOps (VSTS) extension in this repo so please say which one you are using, and if an extension contains multiple tasks which task also*

### Where are you running it?
*You can run the extensions in the cloud or on-premise*
- Azure DevOps Service (VSTS)
- Azure DevOps Server (on-premise TFS, if so what version)

### Version of Extension/Task
*I assume it is the currently public version, if you are using an older version on-premises let me know, but the answer will probably involve upgrading to the currently public version*

### Expected behaviour and actual behaviour

### Steps to reproduce the problem
*Please provide debug logs of the problem, remember you can get these by setting a build/release variable `system.debug=true`. If you don't provide detailed logs when you raise the issue it will almost certainly be the first request I make to diagnose the problem*

A set of tasks based on the versioning sample script to version tamping assemblies shown in the [VSTS documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/vs/alm/Build/scripts/index
). These allow versioning of

* VersionAssemblies - sets the version in the assemblyinfo.cs or .vb (used pre build)
* VersionDotNetCoreAssemblies - sets the version in the .csproj (used pre build)
* VersionAPPX - sets the version in the Package.appxmanifest (used pre build)
* VersionVSIX - sets the version in the source.extension.vsixmanifest (used pre build)
* VersionDacpac - sets the version in a SQL DACPAC (used post build)
* VersionNuspec - sets the version in a Nuget Nuspec file (used pre packing)
* VersionSharePoint - sets the version in a SharePoint 2013/2016/O365 Add-In
* VersionWix - sets the version in a Wix Project
* VersionAndroidManifest - Sets the versionName and versionCode values in an Android project

All these tasks take at least two parameters, which are both defaulted

* Path to files to version: Defaults to $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
* Version number: Defaults to $(Build.BuildNumber)
* [Advanced] Version Regex: The filter used to extract the version number from the build. Default to '\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+'
* [Output] OutputVersion: Outputs the actual version number extracted from build number.

The Assembly & .NET Core versioner also takes the following Advanced option

* [Advanced] Field: The name of the version field to update, if blank updates all. Default is empty

The DACPAC versioner also takes the following Advanced option

* ToolPath: The path to the folder containing the files Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.dll and Microsoft.SqlServer.Dac.Extensions.dll. This should be used if these files are not in the default location either C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\SQLDB\DAC\120 or C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\SQLDB\DAC\120"

The VSIX versioner also takes the following parameters

* If the versionumber parameter is treated as a version number or a build number (from which the version needs to be extracted)
* If the discovered version should be trimmed to 2 digit field

The Android manifest versioner takes the following extra parameters:

* Version Name Pattern - This is the pattern you'd like the publicly visible version name to take in. This should be in the format {1}.{2} or similar but will also work with 1.2.3 etc.
* Version Code Pattern - This is the elements that you'd like to use to store the internal version number that Google uses for detecting if a version of the app is newer than an existing version, both in the play store and on the device. This will concatenate any specifies parts together into a single integer. It Accepts single values like {3} or multiple like {1}{2}{3}, delmiting with `{x}` is optional and should work with 123.
